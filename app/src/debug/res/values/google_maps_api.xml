    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    BE:4B:72:F6:C1:8A:69:58:BE:3B:20:61:E0:C7:C5:5F:5A:74:C7:B8

    BE:4B:72:F6:C1:8A:69:58:BE:3B:20:61:E0:C7:C5:5F:5A:74:C7:B8

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
